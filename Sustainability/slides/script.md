# Sustainability Assessment of Smart Phone Batteries

---

#### Personal Motivation

I've always been fascinated by Electronics and Technology, enjoying tinkering with circuits, microcontrollers, and smartphones. I've built projects aimed at reusing parts from old devices, like phones, but encountered challenges such as safety issues and the planned obsolescence of part design hinders my ability to fully use these parts. These experiences have made me more aware of the environmental impact of electronic devices and particularly the waste they generate.

#### Why SmartPhones?
Smartphones, boasting 4.3 billion users worldwide, remain in high demand with no signs of slowing down. However, their average lifespan of 2.5 years, coupled with annual releases of new models, results in a substantial number of smartphones being discarded annually. This contributes significantly to the ever-growing electronic waste stream, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable solutions in device production and disposal.

#### Why SmartPhone Batteries
Focusing on smartphone batteries for sustainability assessment provides insights into their environmental, social, and economic impacts. Batteries, crucial for smartphone functionality, involve resource-intensive production, potentially leading to habitat destruction and carbon emissions. Addressing resource depletion, toxicity, and pollution issues, as well as improving end-of-life management, are essential considerations. Evaluation also drives innovation towards more sustainable energy storage solutions
